# set_deal_probs

Note that there are many others who have written programs to the same effect that run faster than mine. The program seeks to answer the question: in the game of set, how likely is it that the first deal of 12 cards does not have a feasible set? Also, how do the odds change change when 15 or 18 cards are dealt?

The program simply generates a succession of random draws. It currently only does so for the initial draw.
